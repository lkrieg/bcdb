NAME
       barkeeper - barcode database

SYNOPSIS
       barkeeper [ -d | -k | -r | -v | -h ] [ -f filename ] [ -p | -w port ]

DESCRIPTION
       barcode  database with both Telnet and HTTP/S interface.  It displays
       real-time updates from connected scanners in the web browser.

OPTIONS
       -d, --daemon
              Run process in background.  Any  output  will  be  written  to
              /var/log/barkeeper.log. See FILES section for more info.

       -k, --kill
              Stop  active  background  process.  Ensures  that all database
              state information is preserved for the next execution.

       -r, --restart
              Restart active daemon. Same as -kill --daemon.

       -f, --file filename
              Import additional barcode data from  CSV  file.  Can  be  done
              while  the  daemon  is running in the background.  This option
              has priority over settings found in /etc/barkeeper.cfg.

       -p, --port port
              Set external telnet server port. This option has priority over
              settings found in /etc/barkeeper.cfg.

       -w, --http port
              Set  external  http server port. This option has priority over
              settings found in /etc/barkeeper.cfg.

       -v, --verbose
              Enable verbose logging.

       -h, --help
              Print help text.

FILES
       /etc/barkeeper.cfg
              System wide configuration file. See README for details.

       /var/log/barkeeper.log
              Console output generated while running in daemon mode.

       /var/run/barkeeper.pid
              Active daemons store their process id here. This allows us  to
              stop and restart running barkeeper instances.

       /var/lib/barkeeper/
              Variable state information like the local database.
